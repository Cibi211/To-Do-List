# To-Do-List
I’m excited to share that I’ve completed my first project: a To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
This project allowed me to dive into the world of web development, practicing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Here are some of the features of my Todo List app:
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- 
I’ve learned a lot through this process and am excited to continue building and improving my skills. 
I’m looking forward to any feedback and suggestions for future improvements.
Special thanks to all the online resources and tutorials that helped me along the way.
